You're a mad scientist's lab mouse in the interdimensional void. (It's totally a thing; just ask Wikipedia.) You're hungry. There's food somewhere, and you can tell whether you are moving closer to it or farther away.

## Gameplay

Run game.py to play.

You will begin at the center of every axis of the game.

### Demo mode

Run the game normally. Add details using the shell as requested.

### Regular play (by script)

Fork the game. In game.py, change `run_game(demo=True)` to `run_game(demo=False)`. Edit script.py with your code. Then run the game normally.

## To do

* Clarify gameplay without need to read README
* Add database for high scores and submitted scripts
* Add functionality for limited movement and teleportation
* Add worst-case scoring system for scripts
