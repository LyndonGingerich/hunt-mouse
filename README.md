# Hunt Mouse

You're a mad scientist's lab mouse in the interdimensional void. (It's totally a thing; just ask Wikipedia.) You're hungry. There's food somewhere, and you can tell whether you are moving closer to it or farther away.

## Play by script

* Fork the game.
* In game.py, change `run_game(demo=True)` to `run_game(demo=False)`.
* Edit script.py with your code.
* Run the game normally.
