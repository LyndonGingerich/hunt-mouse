a cup of tea with an unconscionable amount of sugar
a cake beautifully marked with "EAT ME" in currants
a donkey-load of fig cakes
a steak of ROUS
a drink with jam and bread
a bowl of homemade Grape-Nuts
a piece of bread with the butter side down
an almond cookie without any almonds
a vial of extract of llama
a candle missing three bites
a bowl of curds and whey
a morally knowledgeable fruit
a reassuringly tent-toppling bread loaf
a tombstone made of candy
a Wod-Fam-Choc-Sod
